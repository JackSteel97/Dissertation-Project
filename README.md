A dissertation project for Jack Steel. Some configs such as db connection strings have been ommited.

# Abstract
This project presents a successful proof of concept design and a successful implementation of the A*
pathfinding algorithm incorporating pedestrian congestion. The University of Lincoln’s campus and
student timetable data was used to develop this system. It has been shown that considering
congestion during the pathfinding process can provide better results for those wishing to navigate the
campus more efficiently. Congestion adjusted routes can achieve a time-saving of over 70% for a user
navigating the campus on common routes. Analysing the congestion around campus using a heatmap
also provides insight into the locations of bottlenecks on pedestrian movement. This project has laid
the groundwork for future developments in this area and highlighted several key areas for further
work, including further automation of the pathfinding graph generation and investigations into
student behaviours to improve the model’s accuracy. Importantly, this project has shown that the
improved routing algorithm is capable of being processed within an acceptable timeframe for
interactive use. All development was completed with reuse and extension in mind for any further work
or adaptation.
